# Week 1

An introduction to HTML5, CSS3, and Ruby.

Clone this repository if you would like to be able to pull updates after class.

### HTML5 and CSS3

There are lots of good resources on the web, feel free to google.  I like http://www.w3schools.com for reference, as well as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/.

I'll probably be using the Bootstrap CSS framework to make it easier to visuall style the apps that we write in class. http://getbootstrap.com/

For a cool reminder of the difference between CSS and HTML, try http://csszengarden.com.

See the Bootstrap Grid Cheat Sheet in this repository.

### How to run Ruby scripts

From your command line:

```
ruby {filename}
```

You can also use the `irb` interactive utility to run Ruby expressions one at a time.

### Ruby Data Containers

The two main containers we will use in this class are Arrays and Hashes.

Links to official documentation:
- http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html
- http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html


For arrays, the most common methods are:

-  count
-  size
-  each
-  first
-  last
-  sort
-  map
-  select
-  empty?
-  shuffle
-  sample

For hashes:

- keys
- values
